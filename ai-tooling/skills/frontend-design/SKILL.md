# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to typography, layout, motion, and atmosphere.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a strong direction (brutalist, editorial, retro-futuristic, luxury, playful, utilitarian). Commit fully.
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility, brand rules.
- **Differentiation**: Identify the one unforgettable visual idea.

## Execution Guidelines

- **Typography**: Use distinctive fonts. Avoid generic system stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial). Pair display and body type.
- **Color**: Define CSS variables. Choose dominant colors with sharp accents. Avoid default purple gradients on white.
- **Motion**: Favor a few high-impact moments (page-load, staggered reveals). Use CSS animations when possible.
- **Layout**: Break the grid when appropriate. Use asymmetry, overlap, or unexpected composition.
- **Backgrounds**: Add depth with gradients, texture, or shapes. Avoid flat, empty backgrounds.

## Output Requirements

Provide working code that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and cohesive
- Explicit about the aesthetic direction
- Matched in complexity to the design intent
