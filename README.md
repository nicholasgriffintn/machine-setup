# Machine Setup

A simple set of scripts to install commonly used dependencies on my machines, this is particularly useful when I get a new MacBook or I reinstall Mac OS from fresh, which I do a lot.

To get started run this command from the cloned folder of this repo:

`sh ./setup.sh`

And that should install all of the dependencies automatically.
